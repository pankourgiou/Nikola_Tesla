So let's play here you can learn more about Nikola Tesla's patent 609249 https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/patents/us-patent-609249-electric-circuit-controller . you will have to put both files on issues folder on the same folder as the .py program so that it executes normally. The idea is to play a game so that we experiment with a Tesla patent engine trying to change the function of it. I think he knew..he knew propabilities are infinite we sometimes tend to ignore the propabilities. I hope you enjoy!
